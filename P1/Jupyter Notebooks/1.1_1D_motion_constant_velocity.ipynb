This condition is that $t < t\\_max$, meanding as long as the time, t, is less than t_max, the program will loop through and repeat the next three lines. Of vital importance to this loop is our \"counter\", in this case t, which we have to update everytime the loop is run in order to keep track of the elasped time. You know what would be even cooler? Graphing this to have an even more visual result of the motion."
